# To-Do-List

The goal of this project is to create a simple web-based to-do list application using
HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It's allows users to add, edit, and delete tasks. 
Users should be able to add new tasks . Each task should have an option to mark it as 
completed or incomplete by checking/unchecking a checkbox. Allow users to delete tasks 
they no longer need.
